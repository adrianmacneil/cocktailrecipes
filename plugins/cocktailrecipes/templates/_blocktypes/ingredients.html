{# Blocks uses Twig Macros to create reusable form elements 
that you can use throughout your templates.
http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tags/macro.html

If you want to target a single form element, you can target
that macro specifically as in the import statement here
where we only target the checkboxSelect Form Element: #}
{% from "_includes/forms" import checkboxSelect %}


{# You can take a look at the form macros available in the imported
forms file here: /blocks/app/templates/_includes/forms.html

Once you've imported the checkboxSelect macro you can access that 
macro using it's function name and passing it the parameters that
fit our needs.  Since this is a partial template for a blocktype,
the "name", "options", and "values" are set in the blocktype class: cocktailrecipes/blocktypes/CocktailRecipes_IngredientsBlockType.php  #}
{{ checkboxSelect({
    name: name,
    options: options,
    values: values,
}) }}


{# NOTE:
If you want to access all of the form macros, instead of just one,
you can import the full form file: 
{% import "_includes/forms" as forms %}

When you import the full file, you cannot access the macro function
directly as we did above.  You would need to access the macro you 
want using the 'forms' prefix before the function you want to use:
{{ forms.checkboxSelect({
    name: name,
    options: options,
    values: values,
}) }}
#}
